## Introduction/Background

Mirror invariance, a visual mechanism that allows recognition of mirror images, is often present when children are learning to read and write. Dehaene et al. (2009) examined if mirror invariance was retained in adult readers, revealing that mirror invariance is only retained in recognition of images and not words.

This study will replicate Dehaene (2009)'s study. More information can be found in the following links:

[Collected Data](https://github.com/psych251/dehaene2009/tree/main/writeup)

I plan to replicate the section of the study "Behavioral same-different judgments: extension to other visual categories" (Figure 7). I will create the task based on the authors' tasks as provided in the methods section of the paper. The task is comprise of identifying same or different pictures and words based on the participant's respective fluent language. I will not be conducting the rest of the study as they require acquisition of fMRI data which is not possible with the time and resouces provided for this project. 

### Justification of the Study

I chose this study because it relates to visual word processing, a research interest of mine. I am particularly interested in how mirror invariance is mostly present in children and not adults and how that can inform development of word processing. Additionally, with my interest in bilingualism/multilingualism, I am interested in how native non-English speakers process words in their native languages. Finally, I am intrigued about how such language differences can inform acquisition of new words especially of a different language. 


## Methods

### Planned Sample

Since effect size was not stated in the study, I could not perform a power analysis. There will be 26 total participants, 13 French and 13 Japanese speaking participants who are right-handed as followed in the study with mean age of 23.

### Materials

The following materials will be followed precisely:

"All stimuli were presented in black-and-white, and occupied similar locations on screen (approximate width and height : 2° × 2° for Japanese characters and faces; 1.5–4° × 1.5–4° for tools, depending on their compactness and vertical or horizontal main axis; 0.8° × 2.3° for French words). Several precautions were taken to ensure that the task required view-point invariant recognition and could not be performed using simple short-cuts. All stimuli were selected so that they were clearly asymmetrical and maximally distinct from their mirror images. In particular, the faces were not front views, but were viewed and lit from an angle intermediate between profile and front view. Likewise, the Japanese characters were presented in a curvy font (“HG Sei-Kaisho-Tai”) so that they did not contain any vertical or horizontal bars that would be identical after left–right inversion. The French words had an even number of non-repeated letters, so that no letter was repeated at the same location in a word and its mirror-image. 

Finally, the French words were made of lower-case letters b, d, i, l, m, n, o, p, q, u, v, x, and were presented in an 20-point Arial font, slightly modified so that the above letters were exactly symmetrical on screen. As a result, even in mirror-image the words appeared as alphabetical strings made of essentially normal letters (non-French readers could not easily tell that they were not French words). A similar manipulation was not possible with Japanese characters, but we selected characters made of strokes that did not seem artificial once reversed (non-Japanese readers could not easily tell that these were not Japanese characters)." page 1846.

### Procedure	

The following procedure will be followed precisely:

"The stimuli for the behavioral same-different task, performed after fMRI, were 14 French words, 14 Japanese characters, 14 pictures of tools, 14 pictures of faces, 14 unknown script stimuli, and their corresponding left–right reversed mirror images. On each trial, two stimuli from the same category were successively presented at the fixation (200 ms presentation of each image, 300 ms inter-stimulus interval with fixation cross). The participant's task was to decide whether the two stimuli depicted the same object, possibly in mirror- form. Thus, the participants had to respond “same” both to physically identical stimuli (1/4 of trials) and to mirror images (1/4 of trials). They had to respond “different” whenever the stimuli were unrelated, whether they were in the same orientation (e.g. two normally oriented words; two faces in the same orientation; 1/4 of trials), or whether they were in different orientations (e.g. one word followed by a mirror image of a word). The first stimulus, drawn from one of the five categories, was always in standard orientation, and the second stimulus was defined by a 2 × 2 factorial design with factors of identity (same or different object) and orientation (same or different left– right orientation). This design defined a list of 14 × 5 × 2 × 2 = 280 trials, which were run once in random order." page 1846.


### Exclusion Criterias
Response times less than 100 ms and more than 2000 ms. To ensure participants are not pressing keys randomly or are paying attention to the task,response times less than 100 ms and more than 2000 ms will be excluded from analysis. Additionally, those who performed less than 80% accuracy for recognizing same/different images will be excluded to ensure participants are paying attention to the task.


### Differences from Original Study

This replication study will follow the methods and analysis plan from the study as previously mentioned. Images and words in the original study are different from this replication study. The main difference is that the fMRI part of the study is not conducted; so in contrary to the original study, participants wont have any exposure to same-different task prior to this study.

### Analysis Plan

The following analysis plan will be followed from the study:
Median correct response times were analyzed using an ANOVA with group as a between-subjects factor and stimulus category, repetition (same or different image) and orientation of the first image (normal or mirror; the second image was always in normal orientation) as within-subject factors. I will perform an ANOVA test to examine means of correct median response times between the five categories (French and Japanese words, tools, faces, and false fonts).

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

#### Actual Sample
  SAfter the exclusion criterias, the actual sample size was n=23 (10 Japanese-speaking participants and 13 French-speaking participants). The mean age was 36.

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
 none

## Results
In the pilot study, median correct response times did not vary accross categories (p=0.941).

### Data preparation

[Preprocessing of data] was completed prior to analysis to obtain necessary rows from the raw output data of the mirror invariance task. The preprocessing of data can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/psych251/dehaene2009.git/).

### Confirmatory analysis
Analysis is as shown below:

Load necessary libraries

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(emmeans)
```

Open csv files and bind
```{r}
#bind data together
japanese_output <- read.csv(file = "~/Desktop/cleaneddata_japanese.csv", sep = ";")
french_output <-read.csv(file = "~/Desktop/cleaneddata_french.csv", sep = ";")
data<- rbind(japanese_output,french_output)
```

Perform exclusion criterias and filter out worker id who did not meet criteria
```{r}
#exclude response times less than 200 ms and more than 2000 ms
data_rt <- data %>%
  subset( data$samediff_mirrornorm == "D_M" | data$samediff_mirrornorm == "D_T" | data$samediff_mirrornorm == "S_M" |data$samediff_mirrornorm == "S_T", remove= FALSE) %>% #exclude answer from instruction
  subset( data$response == "d" | data$response == "s", remove=FALSE) %>% #getting row with responses
  subset( rt>200 & rt<2000, remove=FALSE) #exclude response times

#accuracy is 80%
data_accurate <- data_rt %>%
  mutate(is.correct= (samediff == "S" & response == "s") | (samediff == "D" & response == "d" )) %>% 
  group_by(workerid) %>%
  summarise(percentage = mean(is.correct))

#filter worker id
filtered_data <- data_rt %>%
  left_join(data_accurate)

#take more than 80% accurate
final_data <- filtered_data %>%
  filter(percentage>0.80)

```

Create new data set with correct mean response time
```{r}
median_rt = final_data%>% 
  group_by(categories,workerid,samediff_mirrornorm,language) %>%
  summarize(medianrt= median(rt, na.rm =FALSE))
```

Run key statistic; key effect of categories on median response time

```{r}
#cateogy effect
anova_results <- aov(median_rt$medianrt ~ median_rt$categories)
summary(anova_results)
#'R','M','J','O','H'="Alphabetic", "False", "Japanese", "Tools","Faces" respectively

#further analysis checking means between categories
cat_lm <- lm(medianrt ~ categories, data=median_rt)
anova(cat_lm)
emmeans(cat_lm, pairwise ~ categories, detailed= TRUE)
```
After running an ANOVA test, category effect on mean correct response times was significant (p=0.04708) which is consistent with the original study. I also ran additional test to compare means of categories between each other, however I did not observe significant results which is inconsistent with the origincal study.

Replicated figure 7:
```{r}
level_order <- c('R','M','J','O','H')
median_rt %>%
  group_by(categories,language, samediff_mirrornorm) %>%
  summarize(mean_medianrt=mean(medianrt),
            ci=1.96*sd(medianrt)/sqrt(n())) %>% 
  mutate(samediff_mirrornorm=fct_relevel(samediff_mirrornorm,  "S_T", "D_T","S_M", "D_M")) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x=categories, y=mean_medianrt, fill= samediff_mirrornorm, bins=10)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = "dodge", width=1.00, color="black")+
  scale_x_discrete(limits=level_order)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(x=categories, ymin=mean_medianrt, ymax=mean_medianrt+ci), width=0.2, position = position_dodge(0.9))+
  
  scale_x_discrete(name= "Categories",labels=c("Alphabetic", "False", "Japanese", "Tools","Faces"))+
  scale_fill_manual(name="Condition",values=c("S_T"="blue4","D_T"="mediumpurple1", "S_M"="firebrick3", "D_M"="lightgoldenrod1"), labels=c("Normal Same","Normal Different", "Mirror Same", "Mirror Different"))+
  labs(y="Response Time(ms)") +
  facet_wrap(~language)+
  theme_classic()
```
The replicated graph includes upper confidence interval since the study did not specify how error bars in Figure 7 was obtained.

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt
In summary, the category effect on median correct response times was replicated in this study (p=0.047). However, there was no significance detected between means of categories. The category affected the median correct time, but there was no difference between categories. As opposed to the study, this replication study can't conclude if mirror invariance vanishes in scripts and not in images or faces. 

### Commentary 
Although the replication showed a category effect, it should be reiterated that the task was not identical to the original study -- images and words used differed from the study. I would be curious what the replication results would be if the images were identical. Furthermore, the original study comprised of parts wherein participants performed similar task as shown in figures 2 and 3 in the article. I am curious if images were presented previously to participants in those studies which could have affected their performance in the part of the study I replicated. A challenge replicating this study was deciding what images and words to include in the task designed -- certain images or words could have affected a person's performance (ie. personal association to certain words or images). Finally, the paper did not include exclusion criterias and details for visualizing results such as description of error bars.
