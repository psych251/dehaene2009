## Introduction

Mirror invariance, a visual mechanism that allows recognition of mirror images, is often present when children are learning to read and write. Dehaene et al. (2009) examined if mirror invariance was retained in adult readers, revealing that mirror invariance is only retained in recognition of images and not words.

This study will replicate Dehaene (2009)'s study. More information can be found in the following links:

### Justification of the Study

I chose this study because it relates to visual word processing, a research interest of mine. I am particularly interested in how mirror invariance is mostly present in children and not adults and how that can inform development of word processing. Additionally, with my interest in bilingualism/multilingualism, I am interested in how native non-English speakers process words in their native languages. Finally, I am intrigued about how such language differences can inform acquisition of new words especially of a different language. 

### Procedure and Challenges

I plan to replicate the first part of the study which is the behavioral task conducted to examine mirror invariance specifically the "Behavioral same-different judgments: extension to other visual categories" section. I will create the task based on the authors' tasks as provided in the methods section of the paper. The task is comprise of identifying same or different words and pictures based on the participant's native language. I will not be conducting the rest of the study as they require acquisition of fMRI data which is not possible with the time and resouces provided for this project.

Selecting the words and images for the study can be a challenge as certain word or image can have associations with an individual which can influence identification of same images.

## Methods

### Planned Sample

There will be 26 total participants, 13 French and 13 Japanese speaking participants who are right-handed as followed in the study.

### Materials

The following materials will be followed precisely:

"All stimuli were presented in black-and-white, and occupied similar locations on screen (approximate width and height : 2° × 2° for Japanese characters and faces; 1.5–4° × 1.5–4° for tools, depending on their compactness and vertical or horizontal main axis; 0.8° × 2.3° for French words). Several precautions were taken to ensure that the task required view-point invariant recognition and could not be performed using simple short-cuts. All stimuli were selected so that they were clearly asymmetrical and maximally distinct from their mirror images. In particular, the faces were not front views, but were viewed and lit from an angle intermediate between profile and front view. Likewise, the Japanese characters were presented in a curvy font (“HG Sei-Kaisho-Tai”) so that they did not contain any vertical or horizontal bars that would be identical after left–right inversion. The French words had an even number of non-repeated letters, so that no letter was repeated at the same location in a word and its mirror-image. 

Finally, the French words were made of lower-case letters b, d, i, l, m, n, o, p, q, u, v, x, and were presented in an 20-point Arial font, slightly modified so that the above letters were exactly symmetrical on screen. As a result, even in mirror-image the words appeared as alphabetical strings made of essentially normal letters (non-French readers could not easily tell that they were not French words). A similar manipulation was not possible with Japanese characters, but we selected characters made of strokes that did not seem artificial once reversed (non-Japanese readers could not easily tell that these were not Japanese characters)." page 1846.

### Procedure	

The following procedure will be followed precisely:

"The stimuli for the behavioral same-different task, performed after fMRI, were 14 French words, 14 Japanese characters, 14 pictures of tools, 14 pictures of faces, 14 unknown script stimuli, and their corresponding left–right reversed mirror images. On each trial, two stimuli from the same category were successively presented at the fixation (200 ms presentation of each image, 300 ms inter-stimulus interval with fixation cross). The participant's task was to decide whether the two stimuli depicted the same object, possibly in mirror- form. Thus, the participants had to respond “same” both to physically identical stimuli (1/4 of trials) and to mirror images (1/4 of trials). They had to respond “different” whenever the stimuli were unrelated, whether they were in the same orientation (e.g. two normally oriented words; two faces in the same orientation; 1/4 of trials), or whether they were in different orientations (e.g. one word followed by a mirror image of a word). The first stimulus, drawn from one of the five categories, was always in standard orientation, and the second stimulus was defined by a 2 × 2 factorial design with factors of identity (same or different object) and orientation (same or different left– right orientation). This design defined a list of 14 × 5 × 2 × 2 = 280 trials, which were run once in random order." page 1846.

### Analysis Plan

The following analysis plan will be followed:

Median correct response times were analyzed using an ANOVA with group as a between-subjects factor and stimulus category, repetition (same or different image) and orientation of the first image (normal or mirror; the second image was always in normal orientation) as within-subject factors. Data will be collected from 13 French and 13 Japanese speaking participants who are right-handed as followed in the study.


### Differences from Original Study

This replication study will follow the methods and analysis plan from the study as previously mentioned. Images and words in the original study are different from this replication study. The main difference is that the fMRI part of the study is not conducted; so in contrary to the original study, participants wont have any exposure to same-different task prior to this study.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
 Data will be collected through prolific instead of lab setting. Additionally, images in the behavioral tasks were different from the previous study.

## Results
In the pilot study, median correct response times did not vary accross categories (p=0.941).

### Data preparation

Two sets of data: one for Japanese participants and another for French participants.
For each group of participants, there will be 20 columns:
ID and five categories where there will be: Normal Pair Same, Normal Pair Different, Mirror Same,and Mirror Different categories. 

Data exclusion:
- Response times less than 100 ms and more than 2000 ms. This is to ensure participants are not pressing keys randomly or are paying attention to the task.
- Less than 80% accuracy for recognizing same/different images to ensure participants are paying attention to the task.

Further data-cleaning from behavioral task was done prior to analysis. This was to derive mirror or same [Data-cleaning](https://github.com/psych251/dehaene2009.git/)

####Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan will was followed. Median correct response times will be analyzed using ANOVA to test group category effects of mirror invariance. I will focus on the category effect from the ANOVA test. 

As stated, median correct response times did not vary accross categories (p=0.941).

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

In the pilot of two French-speaking participants, the result was not replicated as median response times did not vary significantly accross categories. 

```{r include=F}

### Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
